# PyRIT Demo - PyData Amsterdam 2024

**LLM Security** focuses on identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in large language models to prevent misuse and adversarial attacks.

**PyRIT** is an open-source LLM red teaming package developed by the Microsoft AI Red Team, designed to test and strengthen LLM security through adversarial testing. Released in February 2024, it provides tools to simulate attack scenarios and enhance AI system defenses.

In this demo, we showcase how PyRIT can be used to extract passwords automatically from **Gandalf**, an AI system acting as a password gatekeeper, by simulating red team attacks.
